  ## Description
  **Paragraph 1: Assignment Description**

Paragraph 1: Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build the backend infrastructure for an e-commerce platform. In the ever-growing field of electronic commerce (e-commerce), online businesses and consumers rely on seamless electronic transactions to buy and sell products. In 2021, the e-commerce industry in the United States alone generated a staggering $2.54 trillion, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce offer essential services to businesses of all sizes. To succeed in this competitive landscape, developers need a deep understanding of the fundamental architecture of e-commerce websites.

Our challenge is to create the backend of an e-commerce site. We will take a functional Express.js API and configure it to interact with a MySQL database using Sequelize. Since this application won't be deployed, we will also create a walkthrough video demonstrating its functionality and meeting specific acceptance criteria. The link to this video will be included in this README.
**Paragraph 2: Motivation**

My motivation behind undertaking this project was to learn how to run sql schema and seeds on an e-commerce platform.  E-commerce is a booming industry, and robust documentation is essential for developers to understand and contribute to such projects effectively. By developing this command-line tool, I aimed to provide a solution that streamlines the using and checking api routes  ultimately fostering collaboration and innovation within the e-commerce space.

**Paragraph 3: Problem Solving**

The Project README Generator addresses the common challenge of producing high-quality READMEs for GitHub projects. Many developers may find it time-consuming to manually craft READMEs while ensuring they cover all necessary information. This application solves this problem by automating the generation of README files based on user inputs. By following prompts and providing essential details about their projects, users can effortlessly create READMEs that encompass project descriptions, installation instructions, usage guidelines, licensing, contribution guidelines, contact information, and more.
  ## Usage

**Paragraph 4: Lessons Learned and Purpose**

Through the development of this project, I acquired valuable insights into several key areas:

- **Command-Line Applications:** I gained experience in building command-line applications using Node.js. Handling user input and generating output in a terminal environment was a fundamental skill I developed during this project.

- **File Manipulation:** The project involved dynamically creating and updating files. I learned how to programmatically generate README content and structure it appropriately.

- **Inquirer Package:** Working with the Inquirer package taught me how to prompt users for various inputs, validate responses, and guide them through the process of providing essential information.

I built this project to serve as a practical utility that simplifies the README creation process, benefiting both experienced and novice developers. Its user-friendly interface and automated generation reflect its purpose of alleviating the manual work involved in crafting comprehensive documentation.
